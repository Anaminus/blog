Because the colors
are solid, you should be able to get away with using small textures. Tiny
textures. Single-digit resolution textures. Possible, right?</p><p>The problem: Roblox applies linear interpolation to its textures. Here is a
2-by-1 Decal, where the left pixel is white, and the right pixel is black:</p><p><img src=fig1.png alt></p><p>Indeed, the left side is white, and the right side is black, but in between,
there is a smooth, linear interpolation from one pixel to the other.</p><p>When constructing UVs for a mesh, we&rsquo;ll have to find a way around this. Let&rsquo;s
head over to Blender, and work on a simple plane mesh:</p><p><img src=fig2.png alt></p><p>The interpolation of the texture should be set to <strong>Linear</strong>, and the extension
should be set to <strong>Repeat</strong>. This will match how Roblox renders textures on
MeshParts. When we import it into Roblox, it looks mostly similar:</p><p><img src=fig3.png alt></p><p>Notably, the left side begins to fade towards black, while the right side fades
towards white, which proves that the texture repeats. So we&rsquo;ll be able to use
Blender to get a rough idea of what Roblox will render.</p><p>So how do we produce solid colors? We can&rsquo;t just cover the whole pixel with a
face, because half of the pixel is always interpolating to its neighbor:</p><p><img src=fig4.png alt></p><p>To get a solid color, the coordinates have to be in the exact center of the
pixel:</p><p><img src=fig5.png alt></p><p>Two faces, each using one color:</p><p><img src=fig6.png alt></p><p>But does it work in Roblox?</p><p><img src=fig7.png alt></p><p>Indeed! To compare the colors, the top squares are regular Parts, while the
bottom squares are the mesh.</p><p>UV coordinates are reused for SurfaceAppearance textures, so this technique can
be used to set the roughness and metalness of surfaces as well:</p><p><img src=fig8.png alt></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> To set the coordinates of many faces at once, select all the faces, use
the scale tool, and set the scale amounts to 0. This will move all vertices to a
single location, which you can then move to the center of the desired pixel.</p><p><video src=fig9.webm controls loop style=max-width:108%;margin-left:-3.8%></video></p><p>Another interesting idea: Because colors are interpolated, we could set the
coordinates to somewhere besides a pixel center, in order to get more colors.
For example, the simple 2-by-1 white-to-black texture can also be used to get
any shade of gray.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Copyright Â© 2022 Anaminus</footer></body></html>
