Boring Facts: The Position of a Keyboard InputObject will update with the
position of the mouse while the key is held down. This includes the mouse wheel.

Correction: Only some keys do this, including the arrow keys, Return, Backspace,
and Delete.

Further correction: this is caused by key repetition. Generally, a keyboard
object will update with the position of the mouse. However, certain keys that
repeat will switch to the End state, then immediately back to the Begin state,
and repeat again while the key is held down.
