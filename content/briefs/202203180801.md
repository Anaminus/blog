Boring Facts: The UniqueId type also contains an apparently random sequence of
bytes. However, between serialization in the binary and XML formats, there is a
shift by one bit. ~~It is possible that this is an implementation error.~~ There
turns out to be no errors.  When naively comparing the bytes of the two formats,
they appear to be shifted by one bit. The reason is that, in XML, the random
portion is converted directly to bytes. But in the binary format, zigzag
encoding is used.
