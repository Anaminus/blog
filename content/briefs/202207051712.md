Roblox serizes both the `MeshID` and `MeshId` properties.

```xml
<Content name="MeshID"><null></null></Content>
<Content name="MeshId"><null></null></Content>
```

Both have CanLoad and CanSave set. Does studio just let one override the other?
Answer: Yes. The property that appears after overrides the one that appears
before.
