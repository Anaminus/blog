The DataModel as the single source of truth is an awful one, because the engine
calls all the shots, while scripts are second-class.

Because the engine can be made to do nothing by default, I get around this by
conceptualizing my collective codebase as a server, with the data model as a
client. This does create two sources of truth, but the data model is usually a
good little client that behaves as it should.

A consequence is that this "server" must be considered as a whole, so libraries
must be made compatible with this model. But this is fine, because any 3rd-party
library is already going to be incompatible in some way no matter what.

Assuming Roact doesn't expose its own source of truth to be incorporated into
the "server", it could just be treated as another "client" instead.
