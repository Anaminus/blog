Only market a few of your software projects. When you're actively trying to
bring in users, you're creating an expectation of longevity. If you do this for
dozens of projects, you wont be able to maintain them all at once, leading to
stagnation and abandonment.

I've seen a few groups that are doing this. They have handfuls of projects, each
complete with websites, documentation, and other user-friendly concepts meant to
improve usage. I see them and wonder how they plan on maintaining all of these
projects for the next 5 to 10 years.

The more interest there is, the better chance you’ll have of finding other
dedicated maintainers that you can eventually hand off to. However, this is more
difficult for niche products, like those specific to Roblox, where the overall
pool of potential maintainers is smaller.

It’s the marketing that makes a strong promise of long-term maintenance. If you
release something publicly, but aren’t trying to pull in users, then you aren’t
making that promise quite so strongly, so you can get away with lesser or no
maintenance.

There are other strategies, too. You can clearly define the scope of your
project, making it possible to come to a state of completion, and therefore,
little to no maintenance. You can also make it extensible, which transfers some
of the burden to extension authors.
