Here's a module for requiring modules without caching, and monitoring Source
changes. A key difference from other implementations is that loadstring isn't
used. The killer feature is that breakpoints can be synced between copy and
original, so debugging is possible.

Unfortunately, plugins can't access the DebuggerManager, so the debugging method
has to be invoked through the command bar. Fortunately, plugins and the command
bar share the same `_G` table, so a plugin can expose it that way.
