It's fine to put pressure on Roblox for the plugin marketplace, but you have no
business being angry about it. Its financial viability was questioned from the
moment it was introduced.

It has been around two years with no action from Roblox. A very short time to
coordinate a multitude of features across a variety of systems and teams while
also juggling other priorities. Especially considering the happenings during
those two particular years. My impression is that they're working on it. Give
the feature the time it deserves.

Moving to http://itch.io is an excellent way to apply pressure and get Roblox to
reevaluate their priorities. I just think that being upset about it comes off as
entitled.
