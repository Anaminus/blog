An NFT is a string of bytes. Some authority invented out of thin air then makes
the unenforceable claim that these bytes are associated with something else in a
vain attempt to give them value. After that it's just the usual trading of fake
items in a fake market with fake money.

Given that the value of these items hinge completely on this authority anyway,
the blockchain part (and all the dumb shit that goes with it) can be skipped
entirely. This is how Roblox works.

The real point of interest is whether the fake money can be exchanged for real
money. In Roblox's case, the fake money earned from the sales of fake items
cannot be exchanged for real money. However, it can be used indirectly towards
earning "clean" money that can be exchanged.
