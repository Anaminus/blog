A problem with streaming on Roblox is that a client can just move the camera
anywhere, and the server will happily stream whatever is at that location, even
if the player is not meant to be there. Developers need to be able to exclude
areas from being streamed to certain clients.

*2023-01-16 23:14*: As a follow up, it turns out to be possible with the
Player.ReplicationFocus property. Setting it to a dummy part gives the server
the opportunity to deny streaming in. The position of the dummy part matches the
character, except when the character moves to an undesired location.
