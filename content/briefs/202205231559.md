Starting to get annoyed by Luau making features available before they're
complete.

Incidentally, tagged unions aren't refined by the `else` clause.

The *really* annoying thing is that the only way to find out a feature is
incomplete is to get halfway through writing something only to have the type
checker start slapping you with errors for things are logically correct.

If I have a tagged union of `A | B`, and `if v.type=="A" then` refines to type
A, then logically, `else` should refine to type B. Yet I have to find out the
hard way that it doesn't.
