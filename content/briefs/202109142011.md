Bezier curves aren't necessarily bad for railroad tracks, they just need more
constraints. Real tracks have relatively wide minimum curvature to account for
things like speed and axle spacing.

Then there's things like track transition curves. The radius of a track curve
should transition gradually from one radius to the next. There should be a
length of straight track in the transition to a reverse curve.
