I'll set your Parent property to nil. I'll call Destroy on your ass. You must
weigh a singleton, because you're nothing but Debris to me. Your family better
connect to your Died event, because I'll set your Health to 0. You better
BindToClose, because I'm about to shut you down.

No need to set BreakJointsOnDeath, I'll just call BreakJoints directly. We
better update your Transparency, because you're about to become a ghost. Your
ancestry is about to change, kiddo. You're no longer gonna be a descendant of
this DataModel when I'm through with you.

And don't think you're coming back, because I'm setting your RespawnLocation to
nil. You're gonna be FallingDown, but you wont be GettingUp, because I disabled
that Humanoid state. Your thread is suspended, and I'm calling coroutine.close
on you. No need to defer THIS task.

The Garbage Collector'll need several cycles to clean YOU away. Calling
GetFriendsOnline on you always returns an empty array. I'll set your HeadLocked
and max out your NearPlaneZ. By the way these insults are licensed under MIT.
