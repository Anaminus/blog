ProximityPrompts make for great general proximity detectors.

The proximity signals are client-only, so validation is still required. But it’s
a fast and simple solution for detection. I like to think that it’s been
optimized for large numbers of prompts spread across the workspace, so it’d be a
winner in that case.
