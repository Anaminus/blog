Janitor/Maid/etc are different conveniences built on the same core principal:
finalization is established near initialization. I continue to assert that maid
is a pattern, so the best solution is to either roll your own, or pick whatever
best suits your needs.

Here's my implementation, which represents my current theory on the matter:

As for memory leaks, no library will save you from having the wrong mindset
about memory management. Maids and Janitors are just one of the many possible
answers to "What am I going to do about this thing I just created once I no
longer need it?"
