I've been working on a complete rewrite of the Roblox API Reference, which is
why it hasn't been updating. Until it's finished, the new website can be
previewed here, for now:

https://robloxapi.github.io/ref-temp/

Features a simpler architecture, use of full API dumps, creator-docs
integration. Focusing on feature parity with the current site for now, though.
