If you have tooling that makes use of Studio's cookies, Roblox recently changed
how they work in Windows. Cookies are no longer stored in the registry, and are
instead stored as Credentials:

- Studio stores the `https://www.roblox.com:RobloxStudioAuthCookies` credential.
- Its value is a `;` separated list of cookie names (rather, each name has a `;`
  appended, note the trailing `;`).
- The value of each cookie is stored as a credential named
  `https://www.roblox.com:RobloxStudioAuth` + the cookie name.

Tooling will still be able to access these cookies just fine. There's a winapi
for it, so most languages will likely have a library for it. I listed some in
another tweet.

Relevant libraries for some random languages:

- Rust: https://crates.io/crates/wincredentials
- Go: https://github.com/danieljoos/wincred
