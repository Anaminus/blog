Say you have a white wall that you want to paint blue. So you start, but when
you get 3/4 of the way through, you realize that you actually want to paint the
wall green. So you restart, but when you get 1/2 of the way through, you realize
that you actually want to paint the wall red. So you restart, but when you get
1/4 of the way through, you realize that you have a wall that's red, green,
blue, and white. And it turns out to be really difficult to paint your wall when
it's in 4 different states of color at the same time.

Before painting a new color, either finish painting the current color, or
unpaint it. If you're unsure which color you want, paint on different walls.
