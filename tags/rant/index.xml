&lt;p>You are &lt;strong>developing a game&lt;/strong> on Roblox. Some aspect of your workflow is
lacking, so you write a Studio plugin. This plugin improves the workflow of the
&lt;strong>development of your game&lt;/strong>. You rejoice, as you are able to &lt;strong>develop your
game&lt;/strong> better. The hours put into the development of the plugin are compensated
by the increase in revenue deriving from the plugin allowing you to push out
updates and fixes to your game faster and more efficiently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop linking to issues/new</title><link>https://anaminus.github.io/blog/posts/new-issues/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anaminus.github.io/blog/posts/new-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>You have a neat software project. This project has a presence on GitHub. Maybe
you host the source code there, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just leveraging the issue tracker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your project also has a website. You know that your users will have problems
with your software, so you want to direct them from your website to your issue
tracker. You want them to have the most streamlined experience possible, so you
get the bright idea of linking to &lt;a>issues/new&lt;/a>. How convenient! One click,
and they&amp;rsquo;re able to start writing a report immediately! Except, that isn&amp;rsquo;t what
happens.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
