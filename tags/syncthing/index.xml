It&amp;rsquo;s hard
to write blog posts from there. I find it a lot easier to write casually if it&amp;rsquo;s
somewhere else, such as my laptop while sitting in a cushy chair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the blog&amp;rsquo;s local repository is still on my desktop. How do I do things from
my laptop, then? It&amp;rsquo;s just Git, so it should be possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, it is possible, but it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to get going, and there are two parts. The
first part involves setting up the &amp;ldquo;remote&amp;rdquo; repository as a bare repo somewhere
on the desktop. Then separate repositories are cloned from it, one on the
laptop, and another also on the desktop. These are just regular local
repositories, but instead of the remote being GitHub or something, it&amp;rsquo;s just
somewhere else on the desktop. There are some extra considerations, such as what
to do about syncing the &amp;ldquo;local remote&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;remote remote&amp;rdquo; GitHub, but I
haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten that far, and don&amp;rsquo;t really care to.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
